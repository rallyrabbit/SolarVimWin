This was completely forked from https://github.com/SolarVim/SolarVim and I have started re-merging since SolarVim is stale.

The purpose of this project is to fork SolarVim since I cannot get ahold of the owner, maintain a windows compatible version of LunarVim and gradually port each and every Lunarvim change from the original SolarVim fork and work to get a LunarVim that works with windows without much effort.
